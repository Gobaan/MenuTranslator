# Done:  display axis or auto rotate so text is aligned before slicing
# Done: Shrink image before upload to limit time
#   overlay prettily 
# Two possible overlays: -> Full table?
# Go with table approach for now, allow editting of translations 

# Recreate menu but with translations? (doesn't fully work because words change size)a
# Slice menu,  create new similar menu, don't search images, recipes etc until user selects a word
# Maintain relative ordering
# Rotate the menu first?

# Add debug level logging/debug mode

# Move to google cloud?
# Safe guard against doss
#  Parsing can be akward since menus go full retard, users need more control
#  investigate translation to see if i can get the hints
#  Location/Source hints may be value town
#  allow users to fix ocr or edit translation 
#  create lookup table for approximate translations (food lookup table)
# Add test cases?
# Canvas code on debug is retarded right now
