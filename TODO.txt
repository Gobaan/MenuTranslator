#  Add symlinks to index.html and dist files so that cherrypy can launch them (or move cherrypy to the same folder, and autocopy my files over to the dist folder)
#  Redesign ui into components (canvas top, small upload, rotate,and slice buttons. possbly ocr)
#  Vueify the table, simple template that iterates
#  Vueify blurrijg canvas
#  Vueify the main app
#  Clean up extra files (0.5 days)
#  Allow users to rotate (0.5 days)
# Create UI automation test cases ( 1-2 days)
#  Refactor into smaller methods (1 day test case)
#  Collect menus every day (persistent, until crawled,  3 days to write crawler?)
#  scrape some online menus and create test sets
#  Run some tests and document issues with each use case (2 days once data is collected)

Prioritize after testing:
#  Live ocr? (or at least bounding box?) (2 days)
# ocr keyboard (4 days, waterfall)
## Allow Editting and saving of translations /input text? (3 days)
#  create a debug server witg default parameters (1 day)
# CLI for clearing or browsing cache (1 day)

# add test cases (2 days)
# - move logic from server functions to external controller (1 day)

Done
# Display axis or auto rotate so text is aligned before slicing (two days, using projection)
# Done: Shrink image before upload to limit time (1 day)
# Add debug level logging/debug mode (1 day/unmaintained)
# Highlight row on click, fix alignment on blur (few hours)
# EXIF rotation ( 2 days)

# Before release
# Create uptime and pricing alerts
# Limit file size on upload, better message on empty file
# Safe guard against doss
# Move to google cloud?

Stretch
# Recreate menu but with translations? (doesn't fully work because words change size)a?
# Slice menu,  create new similar menu, don't search images, recipes etc until user selects a word
# Maintain relative ordering


# Advanced ML Model
#  Parsing can be akward since menus go full retard, users need more control
#  investigate translation to see if i can get the hints
#  Location/Source hints may be value town
#  create lookup table for approximate translations (food lookup table)
